# TODO

## Client: 
- [ ] add some metadata info about rooms. e.g. Number of active users, total messages sent, creation date.
- [ ] allow for users to view and update their personal details somehow. Username, friends, etc.
- [ ] create init command, for basic app setup.

## Server:
- [ ] Create endpoints for getting and updating user info
- [ ] Create a 'friends' table, and associated repo functions + endpoints
- [ ] Add better metrics and monitoring to the stack
- [ ] Add a server config file/section
- [ ] return messages as a more complex data model, rather than a just message text.
